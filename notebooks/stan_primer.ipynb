    "[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) is a probabilistic programming language for statistical inference written in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stan language is used to specify a Bayesian model and to estimate posterior distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stan was created by a development team consisting of 34 members that includes Andrew Gelman, Bob Carpenter, Matt Hoffman, and Daniel Lee.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple stan interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CmdStan: command-line executable for the shell\n",
    "- RStan: integration with the R software environment, maintained by Andrew Gelman and colleagues\n",
    "- **PyStan: integration with the Python programming language**\n",
    "- MatlabStan: integration with the MATLAB numerical computing environment\n",
    "- Stan.jl: integration with the Julia programming language\n",
    "- StataStan: integration with Stata\n",
    "\n",
    "We are only going to focus on `pystan`. However, the same stan model code can be used acrossed different interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "An explanation of the **algorithms** that make the parameter estimation possible goes beyond the scope of this workshop. I refer to the stan manual section https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_26/reference-manual/algorithms.html for a better overview. I do actually recommend having basic knowledge on sampling algorithms if you intend to use Bayesian parameter estimation in your master/PhD project. Knowing about the sampler and its tuning parameters could help you understand model's diagnostics, failed convergence, failed intialization, etc. Stan uses two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms :the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm and its adaptive variant the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for Bayesian parameter estimation, implemented in different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "An excellent alternative to `stan` in Python is for example [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/), which also uses the NUTS sampler and does not require to learn stan language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise `JAGS` is an alternative to `stan`, and interfaces to `JAGS` are available in Python, R, and matlab as well."

    "### Data Types and Declarations\n",
    "\n",
    "As in C++ (and unlike in Python), every variable used in a Stan program must have a **declared data type**. Only values of that type will be assignable to that variable. Distributions can also be strict in the type of data they accept.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "real x[10];\n",
    "matrix[3, 3] m[6, 7];\n",
    "```\n",
    "Specify a 1D array `x` of size 10 made of continuous, unconstrained data, and a 2D array `m` of size 6x7, whose elements are matrices of size 3x3 (also continuous and unconstrained).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add constraints using `<>`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int<lower = 1> N;\n",
    "real<upper = 0> log_p;\n",
    "vector<lower = -1, upper = 1>[3] rho;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Constraints are important as they specify ranges of data and parameter values for which the density is not zero. Otherwise, the samplers and optimizers may have any of a number of pathologies including just getting stuck, failure to initialize, excessive Metropolis rejection, or biased draws due to inability to explore the tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int<lower=0,upper=1> cond;\n",
    "real<lower=0> sigma;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**QUESTION**: What values can the variable `cond` and `sigma` take?"
